matt was born on the side the road and adopted by a family of mongooses (mongees). <br><br>all he had was his grit and a deep love for ambient funk. <br><br>over the years, he learned how to hunt, gather food and play the altered scale. <br><br>He developed a deep appreciation for jerkob colliflower, spanky purpey, and volfperks and decided to take on massive debt to pursue his passion for music.
